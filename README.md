## A simple Rails test and deployment web-app

RailsDashboard.kdapp is a simple custom web-app for
[Koding.com](http://koding.com/). It shows how to build stuff like this with
the in-house UI API in Koding.

This repo is the source code of the app that is currently hosted in Koding.com.
Feel free to fork and sent pull requests for improvements, fixes, etc. I hope
it makes Rails development for beginners easy.

# Features

- Execute Rails commands directly from Koding, without the need of a Terminal
- Each instance is servable instantly
- Powered by RVM, develop on different rails and ruby versions simultaneously
- Perfectly for testing and learning Rails

# How to use it?
