## A simple Rails test and deployment web-app

RailsDashboard.kdapp is a simple custom web-app for [Koding.com](http://koding.com/). It shows how to build stuff like this with the in-house UI API in Koding.

This repo is the source code of the app that is currently hosted in Koding.com. Feel free to fork and sent pull requests for improvements, fixes, etc. I hope it makes Rails development for beginners easy.

# Features

- Easily deploy Rails instances with one click
- Execute Rails commands directly from Koding, without the need of a Terminal
- Each instance is servable instantly via FastCGI
- Switch FastCGI setup for each instance with one click
- Develop on different rails app simultaneously
- Perfectly for testing and learning Rails

# How to use it?

1. Koding account is required (currently invite-only)
2. Go to "Apps" section and click "Install"
